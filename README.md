## Abstract
An innovative approach to music genre classification that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze song lyrics and metadata. The system processes textual data associated with music tracks to categorize them into different genres, offering a unique perspective on genre classification that goes beyond traditional audio feature analysis.

## Why This Project?
Traditional music classification systems primarily rely on audio features. This project explores a complementary approach that:
- Utilizes rich textual information in lyrics and metadata
- Captures cultural and thematic elements of music through text analysis
- Provides genre insights based on linguistic patterns
- Offers a robust solution when audio analysis is impractical

## Process
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
   - Gather song lyrics and metadata from music databases
   - Clean and normalize text data
   - Apply tokenization and stop word removal
   - Convert text to numerical representations using word embeddings

2. Model Implementation
   - Transform lyrics into document vectors
   - Extract key features using TF-IDF or Word2Vec
   - Implement text classification models
   - Train on labeled genre dataset

3. Feature Engineering
   - Generate word embeddings for lyrics
   - Extract semantic features from metadata
   - Create genre-specific vocabulary profiles
   - Identify key linguistic patterns per genre

## Required Technology & Algorithms
- Python 3.x
- NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, transformers
- Text Processing: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, PyTorch,KNN Algorithm
- Text Analysis Tools: WordCloud, Gensim

## Conclusion
The NLP-based approach to music genre classification demonstrates the power of analyzing textual content for music categorization. By leveraging advanced language processing techniques, the system achieves meaningful genre classification based on lyrical themes, vocabulary usage, and metadata patterns. This text-based method complements traditional audio analysis approaches, offering a more comprehensive solution for music classification tasks.
